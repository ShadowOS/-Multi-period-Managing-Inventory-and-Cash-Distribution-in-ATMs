# (Multi-period) Managing Inventory and Cash Distribution in ATMs

This is generalize model for multi-product, multi-fleet, multi-period inventory routing problem. For ease of understanding we have taken a small example of managing inventory and cash distribution in ATMs. I try to address all the possible scenario or flexibility in this model.
I have study cash filling system in ATMs. As per our knowledge specifically for SBI ATMs, all SBI ATMs in metro cities like Delhi, Lucknow, Mumbai, Bangalore, etc. ATMs are filled from Central currency chest of India. In our model it acts like our depot i.e. starting point of all of our cash loaded vehicles. ATMs are act like facility or demand node. Each vehicle has limited cash caring capacity, each vehicle is hired at certain cost according to its cash caring capacity. Each ATM has 4 cassette with limited amount of space, it implies it can carry limited number of notes in it. In 1st cassette 2000 Rs notes are filled, in 2nd 500 Rs notes and the remaining two 100 Rs notes are filled.
As our model is for multi-period, in each period I can vary working hours of vehicle. I also consider holiday. I have kept different holding cost for each type of note. I try to keep all the possible variation at my end and develop this model.
